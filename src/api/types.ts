/**
 * The collector app's view of the platform, and the seam the mock fills.
 *
 * Two invariants from the engineering brief are load-bearing in these shapes
 * and deliberately impossible to violate through them:
 *
 * - **The client never sends a duration or an amount.** No input type here
 *   carries minutes or money. Effective minutes and amounts arrive from the
 *   server as strings, already computed and already rounded (`quantise` in
 *   `packages/api/src/money.ts` is the only rounding site in the system).
 * - **The app never starts or stops recording.** There is no method for it,
 *   here or on `DeviceTransport`. Recording is the device's own affair.
 */

/**
 * APP-02's six agreements, versioned. Acceptance names the version it saw.
 *
 * These six identifiers are NOT the app's to choose. They are the closed set
 * in the server's `collector_agreements_name_check` CHECK constraint
 * (`packages/store/src/schema.ts`), which is what actually rejects an unknown
 * agreement; the app is the client of that constraint. Keep them byte-equal —
 * `test/mock-api.test.ts` pins the list, so a rename here fails loudly instead
 * of failing at the first real POST.
