/**
 * VENDORED, DO NOT EDIT HERE.
 *
 * `native.ts` and `tokens.ts` in this directory are copies of `packages/design/src/`
 * in mizuharaa/player-one, taken at commit fd6b98e. Nothing below this banner
 * was changed, so the only diff against the original is the banner itself.
 * That package is a pnpm workspace dependency there and cannot be resolved
 * from this repository; publishing it to a registry for two files is more
 * machinery than the two files. Copying was chosen so the two can be diffed:
 *
 *     diff -u src/design/native.ts ../player-one/packages/design/src/native.ts
 *
 * The console, the Electron upload client and this app must render the same
 * colours, so when the platform's tokens change, re-copy both files. Editing
 * either one here silently forks the design system.
 */
/**
 * The React Native form of the same tokens.
 *
 * React Native has no cascade, no custom properties and no media queries, so
 * a theme there is a resolved object chosen once and passed down a context.
 * This module does that resolution and nothing else — every value it returns
 * came from `tokens.ts`, so the app and the console cannot drift.
 *
 * Two things deliberately do not cross over:
 *
 * - **Shadows.** RN's elevation model is not CSS box-shadow, and translating
 *   one into the other produces a shadow that matches on neither platform.
 *   The app declares elevation levels and this file gives it the numbers.
 * - **The stage.** The collector never reviews footage, so the theatre has no
 *   meaning in the app. It is exported anyway, because APP-24's upload-record
 *   screens show video thumbnails and want the same surround.
