/**
 * VENDORED, DO NOT EDIT HERE.
 *
 * `tokens.ts` and `native.ts` in this directory are copies of `packages/design/src/`
 * in mizuharaa/player-one, taken at commit bcd3126. Nothing below this banner
 * was changed, so the only diff against the original is the banner itself.
 * That package is a pnpm workspace dependency there and cannot be resolved
 * from this repository; publishing it to a registry for two files is more
 * machinery than the two files. Copying was chosen so the two can be diffed:
 *
 *     diff -u src/design/native.ts ../player-one/packages/design/src/native.ts
 *
 * The console, the Electron upload client and this app must render the same
 * colours, so when the platform's tokens change, re-copy both files. Editing
 * either one here silently forks the design system.
 */
/**
 * PlayerOne's design tokens, and the only place their values exist.
 *
 * These are consumed by three codebases that cannot share a rendering model:
 * the back-office console (React 19, CSS custom properties), the Path C
 * upload-centre client (Electron, the same CSS), and the collector app
 * (React Native 0.82, plain JS objects — no CSS engine, no `var()`). So the
 * values live here as data and each surface derives its own form:
 * `toCss()` for the web, the exported objects themselves for React Native.
 *
 * Four constraints, each one a decision rather than taste:
 *
 * **Two brands, two jobs.** VNG's sun and PaXini's tech blue are not
 * interchangeable accents. Sun means *action and progress* — a button that
 * does something, a gauge filling toward a shift target. Tech means *data and
 * system* — links, references, anything the machine is telling you. Nothing
 * decorative uses either. The product owner stated the two colour worlds; the
 * hex values are this system's own choice, because no formal VNG or PaXini
 * brand guideline exists (confirmed, not assumed — do not go hunting for an
 * official palette).
 *
 * **The three verdicts are never orange.** `pass`, `partial` and `reject`
 * decide whether a collector is paid, so they own their own hues and are used
 * for nothing else. Partial is violet rather than the obvious amber precisely
 * because amber sits next to the sun ramp and a reviewer must never read a
 * verdict as a brand colour. Every verdict also carries a *shape* at the
 * component level, because red/green colour blindness is common and this axis
 * decides money.
 *
 * **The stage is not the dark theme.** `stage.*` is the near-black surround
 * the review player sits in, and it exists in *both* themes. Reviewers judge
 * `VQ-DARK` and `VQ-OVEREXPOSED`, so pixels adjacent to footage must not
 * shift that judgement — but that argument applies to the region around the
 * video, not to the whole back office. Light shell, dark theatre.
 *
 * **Both faces are self-hosted.** Upload centres sit on a LAN and the counter
 * workflow has to keep working with the link down. A webfont from a CDN would
 * make typography depend on the internet being up, which is the dependency the
 * rest of the system refuses. They arrive through `@fontsource-variable/*` and
 * are bundled, never fetched.
